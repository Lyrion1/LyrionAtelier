Drop any source images here (JPG/PNG). Optional: add a map.json to override matches:
{
 "scorpio-gold.png": "scorpion-aegis-tee", 
 "aries-spark.png": "aries-spark-youth-tee"
}
Filenames can be anything; the pipeline will guess by zodiac/slug keywords if no map provided.
Use slugs exactly as they appear in data/products (e.g., "scorpion-aegis-tee").
